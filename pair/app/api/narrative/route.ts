- Is bite-sized and discussion-worthy 
- Flows logically from the previous point
- Contains one clear, actionable insight or key concept
- Is written in an engaging, informational tone
- Can stand alone as a conversation starter

Each paragraph should be separated by a double line break and represent what would be an individual tweet. Don't include numbering (like 1/n, 2/n) or calls-to-action like "RT/Follow" since this is for internal discussion, not actual Twitter publishing.

Make each paragraph conversational yet informative, like you're explaining complex ideas to a friend. Focus on the most impactful insights first, then build supporting details. End with a thought-provoking conclusion.

Bullet points:
